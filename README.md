# 🌍 AQI App 

The AQI app is a simple project to check your air pollution, based on your geolocation or by searching for a city you prefer.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Open Git Bash

2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the 
   cloned directory.

3. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier
